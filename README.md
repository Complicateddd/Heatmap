# A simple implement for heatmap visualization with PyTorch



## Note

- CAM_heatmap.py  is  for  class-activated-map visualization
- Draw_heatmap.py  is  for  tensor visualization
- main.py  give some example to use this repo



## Prepare

1. You need a trained model
2. A test image for draw heatmap
3. Some modify for model.py file to take the features you wanted to draw



## Usage:

`git clone https://github.com/Complicateddd/Heatmap.git `

`cd Heatmap`



#### Modify main.py

`python main.py`
